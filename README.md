# Weather-Dashboard

In this assignment we were tasked to create a functional weather dashboard. On this dashboard you will have a search form where you will input the City name you are looking for. In the main section, you find the current weather conditions for the Searched City with the 5 day forecast shown below. Finally, with local storage you will find the list of your saved searches. 

## API

In order to pull the weather information from Open Weather, I created an API to collect this information. To collect the information for the current weather, the 5 day forecast and for the UV index, I needed three different links that I plugged my API into. 

## Problems Faced

I ran into multiple issues during this assignment. One issue I faced was to get the informationt at append to the correct position in the HTML dynamically. The  other big issue that I faced was getting the 5 day forecast displayed on the page. It took a while to get this formatted correctly as well as pulling in the correct information.
